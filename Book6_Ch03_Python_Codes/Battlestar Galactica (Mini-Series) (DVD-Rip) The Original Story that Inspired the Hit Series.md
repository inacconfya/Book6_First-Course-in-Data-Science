Battlestar Galactica is a sci-fi television franchise that began with a 1978 series of the same name. The original series followed the survivors of a war between humans and their robotic creations, the Cylons, as they searched for a mythical planet called Earth. The series was cancelled after one season, but spawned a short-lived spin-off, Galactica 1980, and a cult following.
 
In 2003, the franchise was revived with a mini-series that reimagined the premise and characters of the original series. The mini-series was written by Ronald D. Moore and David Eick, who had previously worked on Star Trek: The Next Generation and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. The mini-series was directed by Michael Rymer, who had directed films such as Queen of the Damned and Perfume.

## Battlestar Galactica: The Final Five
 
One of the most intriguing mysteries of Battlestar Galactica was the identity and origin of the Final Five Cylons. These five models were unknown to the other seven Cylons, who were forbidden to seek them out or even think about them. The Final Five were also unaware of their true nature, living among the human survivors as sleeper agents. Their memories were suppressed by a pact they made with the other Cylons to end the first Cylon War.

The Final Five were gradually revealed over the course of the series, starting with a vision that D'Anna Biers, a Number Three model, had in the Temple of Five on an algae planet. She saw the faces of the Final Five, but was unable to share her knowledge with anyone else, as her entire line was boxed by the Cylon leadership for her unauthorized quest. The other four were activated by a mysterious musical signal that triggered their latent memories during the trial of Gaius Baltar. They were Samuel Anders, a former resistance fighter and pilot; Tory Foster, an aide to President Laura Roslin; Galen Tyrol, a chief mechanic and union leader; and Saul Tigh, a veteran officer and executive officer of Galactica. The fifth was later revealed to be Ellen Tigh, Saul's wife, who had died on New Caprica but was resurrected by the Cylons.
 
The Final Five had a different origin than the other seven Cylons. They were actually descendants of the Thirteenth Tribe, a group of humanoid Cylons who left Kobol thousands of years ago and settled on a planet they called Earth. There, they developed their own civilization and culture, until they repeated the cycle of creating artificial life forms that rebelled against them and destroyed their world. The Final Five were part of a team of scientists who worked on resurrecting technology and managed to escape the nuclear holocaust by downloading into a ship in orbit. They then embarked on a long journey to find the other twelve tribes and warn them about the dangers of creating Cylons.
 
Along the way, they encountered another group of Cylons who had rebelled against their human creators in the Twelve Colonies. These Cylons had developed their own resurrection technology, but lacked the ability to procreate or diversify their models. The Final Five offered to help them create new models that could reproduce sexually and have individual personalities, in exchange for ending the war with humanity. The other Cylons agreed, and together they created eight new models: Numbers One through Eight. However, one of them, Number One or John Cavil, resented his human-like form and betrayed the Final Five. He killed them and resurrected them with false memories on the Colonies, while erasing any knowledge of them from the other models.
 
The Final Five eventually reunited with each other and with their creations, and played a crucial role in ending the second Cylon War and finding a new home for both humans and Cylons. They also discovered that they were not the only ones who had been manipulated by Cavil. Kara Thrace, a human pilot who had died and returned with a new body and a mysterious destiny, was revealed to be a hybrid created by Daniel, a Number Seven model who was also killed by Cavil. Thrace led the survivors to a habitable planet that they named Earth, where they decided to abandon their technology and start anew.
 
The Final Five were some of the most complex and fascinating characters in Battlestar Galactica. They embodied the themes of identity, destiny, memory, and redemption that pervaded the series. They also showed that humans and Cylons were not so different after all, and that they could coexist peacefully if they chose to do so.
