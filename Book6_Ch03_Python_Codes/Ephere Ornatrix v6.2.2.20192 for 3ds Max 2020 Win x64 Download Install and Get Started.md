> "I have just jumped ship from another solution and have had the plugin installed less than an hour. I have... used every 3rd party hair solution avaiable over the last decade or so in Max, Maya, and others. This has been the best experience I have had period and I just got started. I have accomplished renders I have been trying to achieve for years on the last 30 minutes. Hair requestes used to be a huge issue,... Now I am actually excited about getting my first Ornatrix assignment. Good job, I cannot recommend ths enough!" - Montrose Edmonds, Creative Director at Tripwire Arts LLC

> "If you are planning on doing any hair work, I would highly recommend Ornatrix. The workflow fits with Max and the flexibility is much greater than Max's default hair system. Ephere does a great job supporting it as well." - Martin Coven, Launch Studio

> "With the release of version 1.8, Ornatrix has evolved into Blur's full-fledged studio hair solution... Its integration into VRay now allows us to beautifully render 100s of thousands of hairs quickly and efficiently right inside our more comprehensive scene files, with full respect to VRay's GI lighting features, motion blur, and DOF.... This update has brought a level of power and control that was previously unavailable to us. The results have set a precedent for what hair can be inside 3D Studio Max." - Danny Young, Blur Hair TD
